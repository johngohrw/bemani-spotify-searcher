# bemani spotify searcher

easily search spotify using bemani song titles

made this over only a few hours for my own use (i wanted to build a playlist) so please don't mind the quality of the site.

[the site](https://bemani-spotify-searcher.netlify.app/) - [a playlist of the songs i managed to find with this](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2eiaPdh3sFELbCehBqbxY9?si=a6dba66a33dd44f3)







### update: 
spotify recently [nerfed their developer API](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2025-04-15-updating-the-criteria-for-web-api-extended-access) to no longer include the song preview URL, so sadly nothing will play from the site anymore.
